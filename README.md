# sup ✌


#### If you're reading this then you're either a colleague👨‍💻 working with me on some assignment, a possible contractor🔎 looking for something interesting, or someone who is trying to look up solutions for their own project by reading random Github repos (im kidding ^^).

#### ⭐If you're on of the two latter options, i guess i gotta present myself. Sup, I'm Carlos (or Cadu), young programmer and student, and I love learning new things, creating projects using some fancy technology that the YouTube algorithm decided to send me, and reading. 💼I have experience with both fullstack React Native and Java backend development.

#### 💪I strive to work on projects that make a difference on the real world, so if you have something in mind for me, send me an [email✉](mailto:carlosefdesantana@gmail.com) or reach me out on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cadusantana/).
